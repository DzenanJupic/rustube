/// A descrambler used to decrypt the data fetched by [`VideoFetcher`].
///
/// You will probably rarely use this type directly, and use [`Video`] instead. 
/// There's no public way of directly constructing a [`VideoDescrambler`]. The only way of getting
/// one is by calling [`VideoFetcher::fetch`].
///
/// # Example
/// ```no_run
///# use rustube::{VideoFetcher, Id, VideoDescrambler};
///# use url::Url;
/// let url = Url::parse("https://youtube.com/watch?iv=5jlI4uzZGjU").unwrap();
/// 
///# tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// let fetcher: VideoFetcher =  VideoFetcher::from_url(&url).unwrap();
/// let descrambler: VideoDescrambler = fetcher.fetch().await.unwrap();
///# }); 
/// ``` 
/// 
/// # How it works
/// (To fully understand `descramble`, you should first read how [`VideoFetcher`] works).
/// 
/// Descrambling, in this case, mainly refers to descrambling the [`SignatureCipher`]. After we 
/// requested the [`VideoInfo`] in `fetch`, we are left with many [`RawFormat`]s. A [`RawFormat`] is 
/// just a bucket full of information about a video. Those formats come in two flavours: pre-signed 
/// and encrypted formats. Pre-signed formats are actually a free lunch. Such formats already 
/// contain a valid video URL, which can be used to download the video. The encrypted once are a 
/// little bit more complicated.
///
/// These encrypted [`RawFormat`]s contain a so called [`SignatureCipher`] with a the signature 
/// field [`s`] in it. This signature is a long string and the YouTube server requires us to 
/// include in the URL query or we get a `403` back. Unfortunalty this signature isn't correct yet!
/// We first need to decrypt it. And that's where the `transform_plan` and the `transform_map` come
/// into play.   
/// 
/// The `transform_plan` is just a list of JavaScript function calls, which take a string (or an 
/// array) plus sometimes an integer as input. The called JavaScript functions then transforms the 
/// string in a certain way and returns a new string. This new string then represents the new 
/// signature. To decrypt the signature we just need to pass it through all of these functions in a
/// row.
/// 
/// But wait! How can we run JavaScript in Rust? And doesn't that come with a considerable overhead?
/// It actually would come with a vast overhead! That's why we need the `transform_map`. The 
/// `transform_map` is a `HashMap<String, TransformFn>`, which maps JavaScript function names to
/// Rust functions.
///
/// To finally decrypt the signature, we just iterate over each function call in the the
/// `transform_plan`, extract both the function name and the optinal integer argument, and call the 
/// corresponding Rust function in `transform_map`.
/// 
/// The last step `descramble` performs, is to take all [`RawFormat`]s, which now contain the 
/// correct signature, and convert them to [`Stream`]s. At the end of the day, `Stream`s are just
/// `RawFormat`s with some extra information.
/// 
/// And that's it! We can now download a YouTube video like we would download any other
/// video from the internet. The only difference is that the [`Stream`]s [`url`]
/// will eventually expire.
